I came across the book's advertise in the APS's Physics Today 
magazine and as an Afghan physicist, I ordered the book right away.

As the title says the book describes the extremely hard journey of Sola (pseudonym), 
an Afghan girl from Kandahar, towards education and free life. The story is very 
motivating and the book is written in a nice narrative that summarizes recent history 
of Afghanistan. From her parents childhood, when Afghanistan was a monarchy under 
Zahir shah and many coup d'Ã©tats that happened. The wars with the Soviet union, and the 
rise of Islamic jihad in Afghanistan. The prolonged civil wars and life under Taliban regime. 
U.S. invasion and establishment of a new government till their withdrawal in 2021.

Some of the earlier events, particularly those involving her parents, resonated with me, 
as I had heard similar stories from my own parents who witnessed first hand. For example, 
my father was on a bus in Kabul going to school when Daoud's coup happened in 1973. 
Reading Sola's memoirs felt personal, as it connected with the experiences and stories shared 
within my own family. The more recent events (over the last 25 years) were events I had been 
following closely, despite being born in Iran and not residing in Afghanistan. 
As a refugee my life was always entangled with the incidents in Afghanistan.

Even though I had a general understanding of the situation in Afghanistan through communication 
with relatives there, Sola's account shed light on many specific details of life in Kandahar, 
a region distinct from Kabul that my relatives are living. She highlights these differences, 
particularly when she describes her visit to the U.S. embassy in Kabul.

There are a couple of sad observations from her memoirs that I could not handle the absurdity. 
Such as the story she tells about the first English teacher she had in her youth in Kandahar. 
The teacher was born in Canada to Afghan parents and grew up there, and yet her parents were 
so cruel to send her back to marry a man 18 years older than their daughter in Afghanistan. 
How could someone treat their own daughter this way? Even after living in a country like Canada, 
they remained the same people. I can somewhat understand this happening in an environment where 
everyone does it, but not when someone is born in Canada. This scenario points to a significant 
failure in integration policies, where the social pressures from relatives in Afghanistan appear 
to outweigh the values and opportunities provided by the new society.
Even if there are parents making such unimaginable choices, I believe it should not be allowed 
to happen to a girl born in a place like Canada, who, most probably went through a free country 
education system as well. There ought to be awareness and structures for vulnerable people to report 
and fight back. The story is devastating. She mentions a similar story when she visits one of her relatives 
in New York, which is happening right now and is a current issue. It is not possible for me to believe 
that there are people right now imprisoning their wife and daughters in places such as New York!

Another point that took my eye, was that she never mentions a help from her father. It's always her mother, 
"Moor" as she calls, that accompanies her. It's perplexing to note that Sola's father had always a strong 
desire to stay in Kandahar even under the partial rule of the Taliban. The reason is not very clear to me. 
The question also puzzles Sola as she mentions a couple of times in the book. I cannot think of a business 
that could not be moved to another city of Afghanistan, somewhere with more freedom or at least safer. 
Despite being financially secure as it sounds and they could send the boys for education to private 
schools and even abroad, he keeps staying in Kandahar. This opens the space to speculate that the father 
was also supporter of the Taliban ideas, despite being educated. However, comparing to relatives, he was 
relatively open-minded that did not prevent Sola from going to the U.S., as she quotes her father's cousin 
in New York telling her "I don't understand how your father let you come alone to the United States. I would 
rather die than send my daughter alone to a new country."
But at the end of the book, the only time that her father decides to leave Afghanistan is when Taliban 
regains power after U.S. troops leave the country. This suggests that even individuals who might support some 
of the Taliban's ideas are fleeing their government.

It's important to note that these events largely occurred during the 20 years when the U.S.-backed government 
held power in Afghanistan until 2021. During this time the media was quite free compared to countries like Iran. 
Women singers could hold concerts in the football stadiums that once (and sadly again) Taliban was using 
to stone women to death in public. I was hopeful that this freedom and also spread of internet connection, 
could change the situation in Afghanistan, but reading about the accounts I mentioned above, it seems that a 
majority of men in Afghanistan are not tolerant of women's freedom and right to live as a human. Set aside the 
freedom of media, they keep the same attitude even in free countries as Sola describes her relatives. 
This is distressing! It's worth noting that she describes how they watched "Afghan Star," a singing 
competition featuring numerous female singers, yet they exhibited cruelty toward women in real life. 
I couldn't reconcile the situation described in Kandahar with what I saw on Afghan TV, which showcased empowered 
women, including female reporters, hosts, singers, and even a few politicians.
Perhaps if the U.S. had remained for another 20 years, the new generation, like Sola's nephew Hamid, 
might have undergone transformation and grown up with a view of women as equals. However, with the U.S. 
withdrawal, everything has regressed to the state it was before the invasion. Regrettably, the U.S. concluded 
that it had failed to alter the situation there and couldn't allocate further resources to combat the Taliban. 
Maybe this is a valid conclusion, and it is the women in Afghanistan who must assert their rights independently; 
otherwise, improvement may remain elusive even with foreign intervention. Propaganda that Americans or the West 
aim to corrupt women will persist, and deeply religious segments of Afghanistan will most probably succumb to 
such beliefs, feeling compelled to oppose it. However, if the women within Afghanistan collectively reach the 
realization that they've had enough, a transformation may be possible. Nevertheless, this struggle is marked 
by fear and violence. Even Sola advises her nephew to not to talk about women rights and freedom.
After Taliban's take over, there has been many protests by women, but unfortunately they have all been suppressed 
by Taliban. Activists have been imprisoned and violent punishments will follow people who raise their voices.

The similar situation is now going on in Iran. The Zan, Zendegi, Azadi movement (or as some call it revolution) 
is the result of women standing up and shouting out loud that they have had enough. The situation of women in 
Iran is far better than in Afghanistan, however the same kind of extremism and view of women is present in 
Iran as well. Many believe that this is mostly because of the Islamic republic regime, however I think the 
cultural and religious beliefs of the society is the main problem which supports the oppression of women. 
Sola's book amazingly shows this deep cultural problem. Fathers similar to Sola's father and brothers such as her 
brothers do not see women as equal, capable, free, human, and this is a main reason why regimes like Taliban, 
or Islamic republic can continue to live in my opinion.

People like Sola had the courage to have a dream and fight for it. However, Sola is the one fortunate enough to 
succeed, but there are countless others that they fail. Although, I have never lived in Afghanistan except a 
10-day visit to Kabul and 3-day stay in Herat, to get Afghan identification in 2012, my life has always been 
affected by it and its developments.

At the end I have to say that I am very happy for Sola that she could overcome this fight and find a way to free 
life. I know how hard it is to fight for recognition and against being ignored all the time, as growing up as 
an Afghan refugee exposed me to numerous discrimination and struggles. However, I was lucky enough to not 
to live under constant suicide-bombings and air strikes. I enjoyed reading her memories and recommend reading 
this inspiring story to everyone. At the same time I have to say that I feel very sad about the situation that 
is getting worse and worse in Afghanistan everyday, especially for women, and wish they can also become free and 
have a decent life, being able to dream and reach their dreams.
