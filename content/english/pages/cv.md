###### Thesis: Optimal navigation strategies of Plankton

###### Supervisor: Kristian Gustavsson

Different species of Plankton, such as copepods, have very detailed environmental perception 
by measuring flow disturbances. They are also capable of weak navigation in competition with 
being advected. This suggests that, they should have learned by evolution, to leverage different 
flow signals to increase their survival chance.  For example, vertical migration is a daily 
habit of Plankton, that their survival is highly dependent on. During my PhD, I worked on mathematical 
modeling of Plankton navigation and finding optimal strategies for purposes such as, vertical migration, 
and high strain avoidance. I used reinforcement learning to find possible strategies and relevant 
flow signals that Plankton can exploit as an active microswimmer. For this purpose, 
I used C/C++ for the main simulations and machine learning, and different libraries of Python 
(numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly) to analyze the resulting data. For the deep RL training 
I used TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries in Python.

###### Statistical properties of particle spread in quenched random media

###### Supervisor: Saeed Davatolhagh

Anomalous diffusion has attracted a large number of scientists in recent years as it is observed
in an enormous number of phenomena, from bacterial dynamics to foraging movements of the
larger animals. In my thesis, I investigated the anomalous diffusion and transport characteristics,
such as MSD, first passage time probability, aging, ergodicity breaking and correlations, in tracer diffusion
in a random quenched velocity field, known as Matheron-de Marsily. I used C and Python for the simulations
and analyzed the data using Python and MATLAB.

###### Kuramoto model simulation of a system of oscillators

Studied synchronization transition in a one-dimensional
periodic system of phase-oscillators interacting with asymmetric periodic function. The
oscillators interact with a saw-tooth function with the control parameter and the oscillators
frequencies are distributed according to a normal Gaussian probability distribution function.
Numerical simulations showed that the system exhibits a second order phase transition and
the critical point of the model found to be extremely depending on the asymmetric control
parameter. I used C for the numerical simulation and Octave for the analysis of the results.

###### Light curve and frequency analysis of delta scuti variable star

Observed the variable star, AE UMa, at [Biruni observatory](https://obs.shirazu.ac.ir), Shiraz University. Analyzed the data using different 
astronomical software and packages and reported the result to IBVS(Information Bulletin on Variable Stars). 
In the process I learned observational techniques, image processing, and data reduction, working with 11 and 20
inch telescopes of the observatory and various detectors.
