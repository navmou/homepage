Sunset by the "[kvinna vid havet](https://goteborgkonst.se/artwork/kvinna-vid-havet-sjomanshustrun)", which
literally means "woman by the sea", and is the symbol of mothers/women that were waiting for their husbands/sons 
sailing. This is taken by a 400mm mirror lens, and Canon90D.

### A glimpse of biography

My name is Navid ([*næ'viːd*], نوید ), and in Persian it means good news! I did my bachelor and master studies in my 
hometown [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz), at [Shiraz university](https://shirazu.ac.ir/en/home). 
Starting the bachelor, I got very interested in astronomy, and
therefore, most of my time was spent at [Biruni observatory](https://obs.shirazu.ac.ir/), which had 
([not anymore!](https://www.science.org/content/article/door-open-iranian-astronomers-seek-collaborations-their-new-world-class-telescope)) 
the largest professional telescope of Iran. I worked on variable stars photometry during that time and 
was imagining my future as an astronomy professor. However, life pushed me in another direction and I 
persued my master studies at complex systems group at Shiraz university. 
For my master thesis I worked on
[anomalous diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_diffusion) of tracers in random velocity fields.
A brief summary can be found in [here](../pdfs/phd_interview_presentation.pdf).
Starting my PhD in the beginning of 2020, under supervision of 
[Kristian Gustavsson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w4AWzOoAAAAJ&hl=sv),
at the [physics department](https://www.gu.se/en/physics) of [Gothenburg university](https://www.gu.se/en),
I have been working on somewhat similar project to my master thesis. However, it is much more realistic. 
I work on active particles swimming strategies in turbulent flows. My work, includes fluid mechanics, active matter, 
non-equilibrium physics, and machine learning. Also, since my studies are mainly focused on Plankton, 
I would dare to say it touches biology as well ([I do not want to make biologists angry](https://elifesciences.org/articles/40018)!).

The PhD in Sweden is actually divided into two parts. First part (24-30 months) is called Licentiate and is a real degree in 
Sweden. One needs to write a thesis and have a less formal defense with opponent. I did my defense with 
[Enrico Calzavarini](http://www.ecalzavarini.info/) as my opponent in June 2022 and if you like 
you can check out my Licentiate thesis [here](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/71497). If everything goes as planned, 
I will be defending my PhD in 2024.

Apart from physics, I am intersted in philosophy, photography, and cooking. Also, who is not interested in politics? ;-)<br>
Philosophy in general, and more specifically philosophy of science, and history of philosophy and science has always been 
my interest in reading. In photography, I am in love with astrophotography. This is in fact stemming from my love for astronomy,
and since my last shift of gears in carrier, it is the small hole that makes me feel connected yet. There are many great 
astrophotographers out there, but I cannot ignore mentioning [Babak Tafreshi](https://babaktafreshi.com/).
Unfortunately, since Sweden is most of time cloudy, there is not many chances of capturing the sky. This is why I got interested in
street photography since 2022. In street photography, I admire works by [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson), who is well known for his book
"[The Decisive Moment](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6048685)". Among more recent photographers,
I enjoy works of [Alan Schaller,](http://alanschaller.com/) who is amazing in capturing the contrast.
You can find a few of the photos that I have taken in [Photography](../photography), also I share sometimes on 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/navmou) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/189947020@N08/). 

I write blog-posts, every now and then, which can be found in [Blog](../blog).
