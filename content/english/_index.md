	I am a [<u>PhD candidate</u>](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/sayednavidmousavi) 
        at the [<u>department of physics</u>](https://www.gu.se/en/physics) 
        of [<u>Gothenburg university</u>](https://www.gu.se/en), in Sweden.
        My research is focused on active matter physics. More specifically, I study the 
        optimal navigation strategies of micro-swimmers, such as [<u>Plankton</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton) in complex flows. <br>
        These small creatures, due to their tiny body size, live in viscous fluid regime, and therefore their experience
        of swimming is quite different from ours [1]. However, they still have an amazing perception of their environment 
        and limited control over their navigation, hence the name Plankton (Plankton means drifter/wanderer).
        This suggests, that they should be able to adaptively control their navigation, in order to achieve different goals.<br>
        What I do, is to simplify ([<u>not more than enough</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow)!) 
        the problem to mathematically model their dynamics and simulate a somewhat
        **smart swimmer** in [<u>turbulent flow</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence).
        Then I can (maybe!) see how does such a swimmer optimally reach certain goals. For example, 
        [<u>diel vertical migration</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diel_vertical_migration), which is claimed to be 
        the largest biomass migration happening everyday on Earth, is a long standing open question [2], that we tried
        to study from a mechanical prespective. The results are summarized in papers [3] and [4].   
        For the **smart** part, I use machine learning. Among different machine learning approaches, **reinforcement learning** [5]
        is a great framework to be used in solving this problem. If you are interested, you can read more in my 
        [<u>Licentiate thesis</u>](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/71497), and soon, my PhD thesis :-).<br>
