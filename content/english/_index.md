	I am a post-doctoral researcher 
        at the [<u>department of physics</u>](https://www.gu.se/en/physics) 
        of [<u>Gothenburg University</u>](https://www.gu.se/en), in Sweden.
        My research is focused on active matter physics. More specifically, I study the 
        optimal navigation strategies of microswimmers, such as [<u>Plankton</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton) in turbulent flows.
        <br>
	<br>
	In my doctoral studies, I found mechanisms which enable microswimmers
	with weak steering abilities to travel faster than their propulsion speed by exploiting the background turbulent flow [1].
	Furthermore, I found strategies that such swimmers can benefit, in order to avoid regions of the flow with high strain, 
	which led to observation of emergent counter-current swimming behavior [2]. For a public press article you can check out 
	[<u>here</u>](https://www.gu.se/en/news/model-shows-how-plankton-survive-in-a-turbulent-world), and for detailed description
	of the results and methods, feel free to look into my thesis [<u>here</u>](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/80594).
	<br>
	<br>
	To solve such problems, one needs to employ methods from **fluid physics**, **dynamical systems**, and **statistical physics**.
	Recently, machine learning algorithms, such as **reinforcement learning** [3], have shown great potential in addressing active 
	matter physics problems [4,5], including the navigation challenges I work on. Therefore, I utilize various machine learning 
	techniques to build mathematical models of **smart** swimmers and study the optimal behaviors these swimmers can adopt 
	to achieve different survival goals.
